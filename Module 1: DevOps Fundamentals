----Objective of Module 1----

By the end of this module, you will be able to:

Explain what DevOps is

Explain why DevOps is needed

Explain CI/CD

Explain the DevOps lifecycle with tools & AWS

Answer basic DevOps interview questions confidently



What is DevOps ?

DevOps = Devlopment + Operations

-->DevOps is a culture and set of practices that combines Development and Operations to automate software delivery.

-->Devops is combination of culture, Automation and tools that helps to deliver applications faster and more Reliable.

key point:

* Where DevOps reduces manual work and deployment issues by automating the entire software delivery process

* Where Agile methodology concentrates on faster delivery , DevOps Focous on faster and stable Delivery or deployments


why DevOps is needed ?

We Use to fallow Traditional Model before DevOps Came into Picture Where in traditional method we use to do

-->Development and Operations worked separately
-->Manual deployments
-->Slow releases
-->Frequent failures

After the emergence of DevOps, everything transformed — processes became faster, collaboration improved, and the way software was delivered changed forever.

-->Automation
-->Faster Deplyments
-->Continous feedback
-->Stable environments

Key differences on Agile and DevOps
-----------------------------------

| Agile                  | DevOps                           |
| ---------------------- | -------------------------------- |
| Focus on development   | Focus on deployment & operations |
| Sprint-based coding    | Continuous delivery              |
| Ends after development | Continues into production        |

What is CI/CD ?

lets say it is a heart of DevOps 
CI/CD is an automated process that builds, tests, and deploys code whenever developers push changes.
CI/CD automates the complete process from code commit to deployment.

CI – Continuous Integration
---------------------------
Developers frequently push code to a shared repository
Each commit automatically triggers:
Build
Tests
Code quality checks

Before CI:

Developers merged code once in weeks
Huge conflicts
Build failures at the last moment

*****CI solves this by early detection of issues.*****



Real-Time CI Flow 
------------------

---->Scenario<----(Go through this to get the basics — once you work with all the concepts, it’ll make much more sense)

You are working on a Java application.

Tools Used

 ->GitHub (code)
 ->Jenkins (CI)
 ->Maven (build)
 ->SonarQube (code quality)
 ->AWS EC2 (Jenkins server)

Flow

 1.Developer pushes code to GitHub
 2.GitHub webhook triggers Jenkins
 3.Jenkins pipeline:
    .Pulls code
    .Runs mvn clean install
    .Runs unit tests
    .Runs SonarQube scan

Build result:

  SUCCESS → move to CD
  FAILURE → stop pipeline

CI Jenkins Pipeline

 Checkout → Build → Unit Test → Code Quality


Continuous Delivery (CD – Delivery vs Deployment)
-------------------------------------------------
Continuous Delivery
 .Code is always deployable
 .Deployment needs manual approval

Continuous Deployment
 .Code is automatically deployed to production

in Real time most of the companies user Continous Delivery


Real-Time CD Flow (AWS Example)
🔹 Tools Used
    ->Jenkins
    ->AWS EC2 / ECS / EKS
    ->S3 (artifacts)
    ->Load Balancer

🔹 Flow

  1. CI completes successfully
  2. Artifact stored in Nexus / S3
  3. Jenkins triggers deployment job
  4. Application deployed to:
      EC2 (traditional)
      ECS / EKS (containers)
  5.Health check via Load Balancer
  6.Rollback if deployment fails
